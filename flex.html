                <h1>SEMANTIC HTML</h1>
                <p>
                    <b>Semantic HTML</b> is the proper use of HTML to emphasize the semantics, or the meaning, of content
                    in wed pages and web applications rather tha simply defining its appearance.
                    Traditional web browsers and numerous other user agents process Semantic HTML. CSS is also used to
                    suggest its appearance to users.
                </p>
                <h2>why should we use semantic HTML</h2>
                <P>
                    Semantically valid HTML helps screen readers, search engines, and other user devices decide the
                    context and significance of web content. To effectively represent content meaning, developers choose
                    appropriate HTML elements regarding the intrinsic meaning of a web page rather than how they appear
                    visually.
                </P>
                <h2>Five main benefits of using semantic HTML:</h2>
                <ul>
                    <li>Lighter code</li>
                    <li>Maintainable code</li>
                    <li>Accessibility</li>
                    <li>Search visibility</li>
                    <li>Future-proofing</li>
                </ul>
                <h2>text-level html semantic</h2>
                <p>
                    In HTML, text-level elements such as <li> em, cite, and strong</li> add semantic data within
                    <i>phrasing</i> content, to clearly indicate stress, emphasis, citations, and strong importance, to
                    name a few examples.
                </p>
                <h2>Sectioning HTML semantics</h2>
                <p>
                    With the progress of HTML5, new elements are now available that add semantic meanings to entire
                    sections of web page sections, including
                    <li>nav, header, aside, and footer.</li>
                </p>
                <h2>Structured Metadata - beyond Semantic HTML</h2>
                <P>
                    Several technologies build on HTML syntax to signify objects, such as events,
                    organization, products and people, to achieve more precise semantics than those
                    achievable only with HTML.
                    For example, search engines are already using formats such as <i>Microformats</i>,
                    RDFa, and <i>Microdatas</i> to obtain meaningful data from a web page as part of the
                    next era of the Semantic Web.

                <h1>WHY IS IT BETTER TO WRITE INTERNAL STYLLING IN THE HEAD AND NOT THE BODY?</h1>
                <p>
                    It is better to put internal styling inside the head because when the CSS is declared before the body starts, it
                    enables the styles to load faster. This is the reason users see styles like background color before the content
                    (in the case of slow network connection).
                </p>
                    
                <p>  Also, if the styles are somewhere in the body, the browser has to re-render the page (new and old when loading)
                    when the styles declared has been parsed.
                    This means that you can use the style tag everywhere you want but the only implications are decreased page
                    performance due to possible reflows/repaints once the browser hits styles further down in the page.
                    Putting CSS in body means it is loaded later. 
                </p>

                <p>the most recent versions of the HTML spec now permits the <i>style</i> tag within body elements.
                Also the <mark>scope</mark> attribute which used to be prerequisite to have a style tag in the body is now obsolete.
            This means, that we can use the <i>style</i> tag everywhere you want, the only implications are decreased page perfomance due to possible reflows/repaints once the browserhits styles further down in the page tree.
